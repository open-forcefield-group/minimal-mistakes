The Open Forcefield Group makes a number of resources available to the community, including open source software, high-quality curated open datasets, and forcefields.

---

## Software

- [openforcefield](https://github.com/openforcefield/openforcefield): A python toolkit from the Open Forcefield group for the development and use of modern molecular mechanics forcefields based on direct chemical perception and parameterized with rigorous statistical methods. This also provides the SMIRNOFF forcefield format.
- [open-forcefield-tools](https://github.com/openforcefield/open-forcefield-tools): Development space for property calculation and forcefield parameterization tools.
- [SMARTY](https://github.com/openforcefield/smarty): A simple prototype implementation Bayesian atom type sampling using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) over SMARTS types. This also provides the SMIRKY tool, which samples over SMIRKS patterns for chemical perception of parameter types.

## Datasets

- [open-forcefield-data](https://github.com/openforcefield/open-forcefield-data): Curated datasets from the NIST ThermoML database to be used for forcefield parameterization.
- [MiniDrugBank](https://github.com/openforcefield/MiniDrugBank): A repository to track the creation and evolution of the MiniDrugBank Molecule set, filtered from [DrugBank Release Version 5.0.1](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/5-0-1).

## Forcefields

- [smirnoff99Frosst](https://github.com/openforcefield/smirnoff99Frosst): The first general-purpose implementation of a SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) as implemented by the SMIRNOFF ForceField class (in openforcefield.typing.engines.forcefield) for parameterizing small molecules for OpenMM and (via ParmEd and InterMol) a wide variety of other simulation packages.
